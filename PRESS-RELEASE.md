## Problem ##
  Games are a great way of relaxing and having some fun, especially when you can play with other people. However, many of the current online multiplayer games require too much setup and learning to get started. We need more interactive games that are easy to join and intuitive to play.

## Solution ##
  Sumo Chicken gets players into games fast and gives them a fun experience that has them coming back. The gameplay mechanics are intuitive and easy to learn, but an element of competition encourages players to play more and improve.
